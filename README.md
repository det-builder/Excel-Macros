# Excel-Macros
These are various Excel macros that I use for various purposes.

The macros in the Checkbook folder have to do with the QIF importer I wrote.  It takes a QIF file from Quicken and imports it into an Excel workbook.  I did this because Quicken is too bothersome and pesters me too much for more money.   I figured I could write a good enough checkbook register in Excel and it seems to be working very well so far.
